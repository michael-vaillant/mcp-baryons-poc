**Interactive HTML companion for Meta-Connective Physics (MCP) Appendix E.**

This tool demonstrates how baryon massesand constituent quarks can be derived *ab initio* from discrete geometric constraints in a coherence network, without free parameters other than the network topology ($N, k$).

## Overview

This repository contains a standalone **HTML5/WebGL application** that simulates the "Tension Network" model described in the *Meta-Connective Physics* framework (MCP).
MCP proposes a foundational "information physics" framework where reality emerges from a discrete, background-independent hypergraph of Relational Tension Quanta (RTQs). Instead of assuming a pre-existing spacetime, **physical reality is modeled as a lattice of Relational Tension Quanta governed by a complex tension Λ = Λᴾ + iΛᴵ, where Λᴾ encodes metric stiffness and inertial response and Λᴵ encodes phase alignment and coherence, constrained by the monadic conservation law (Λᴾ)² + (Λᴵ)² = Λ₀²**. Controlled by a structural angle Θ, this architecture derives fundamental constants (c, G, ħ) not as independent axioms but as correlated geometric projections of the network state. Thus, MCP tries to unifies cosmology, quantum mechanics, and informational structures as distinct phase regimes of a single, finite-state relational substrate

The software provides a 3D visualization and a numerical solver to explore how:
1.  **Mass arises from geometric drift:** Similar to a *Zitterbewegung* model, mass is generated by the angular defect of a closed loop.
2.  **Quantization:** Stable particles correspond to integer winding numbers ($k$) and loop lengths ($N$) on a discrete lattice.
3.  **Accuracy:** The tool compares the theoretically derived masses against experimental CODATA 2018 values in real-time.

## Key Features

* **3D Visualization:** Renders the topological structure of the particle (Helical/Toroidal drift) using **Three.js**.
* **Real-time Solver:** Adjust input parameters ($N$, $k$, $\alpha^{-1}$) and see immediate effects on the predicted mass ratios ($m_p/m_e$, $m_n/m_e$).
* **Automated Scan:** Includes a "Scan" mode to numerically search for integer solutions ($N, k$) that minimize the error relative to experimental baryon masses.
* **No Installation Required:** Single-file architecture (HTML + JS embedded).

## Scientific Context

This proof-of-concept implements the logic from **Appendix E** of the manuscript:
> **Meta-Connective Physics (MCP): A Foundational Framework**
> *Michaël Vaillant (2025)*

### The Core Logic
In this framework, particles are not fundamental point-masses but **topological defects** in a tension network.
- The **Electron** is modeled as a minimal twist.
- **Baryons (Proton/Neutron)** are modeled as closed loops of tension (3-twist closure).

The mass is derived from the **Geometric Drift**:
$$\frac{m_{baryon}}{m_{electron}} \approx \frac{N \times \text{Drift}(k, \text{geometry})}{\text{Unit Twist}}$$

Where $N$ is the number of coherent steps (loop length) and $k$ is the winding number. The tool visualizes this "Tension/Drift" relationship.
